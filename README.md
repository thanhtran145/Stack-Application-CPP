# Stack-Application-CPP
In this project, I created three different classes to operate the function of the stack.

1. (The Simple Calculator Class) is an easy-to-use tool for doing simple
math. It is a user-friendly calculator that helps you add, subtract, multiply,
divide numbers, and check for balanced parentheses as needed.

2. (Translation Arithmetic Class) gets the Infix Expression
and then gives you the PostFix Expression. It utilizes two standard template library (STL) stacks to handle arithmetic
expressions

3. (N-Queens Class) is created to solve the famous n-queens problem in the data structure by using stacks. Place n-queens on a nxn board so that no queens exist in the same column,
row, or diagonally to each other; I do this by back-tracking using a stack
